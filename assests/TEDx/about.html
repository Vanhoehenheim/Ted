          <h3>What is TED<sup>X</sup>?</h3>

          <p>
            In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED<sup>x</sup> is a program
            of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share
            a TED-like experience. At a TED<sup>x</sup> event, TED Talks video
            and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection.
            These local, self-organized events are branded TED<sup>x</sup>,
            where <sup>x</sup> = independently organized TED event. The TED
            Conference provides general guidance for the TED<sup>x</sup>
            program, but individual TED<sup>x</sup> events are self-organized.
            <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
            annual TED Conference takes place each spring in Vancouver, British
            Columbia. TED's media initiatives include&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ted.com">TED.com</a>, where new TED
            Talks
            are posted daily; the Open Translation
            Project, which provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as
            well as translations from volunteers worldwide; the educational
            initiative TED-Ed. TED has established the annual TED Prize, where
            exceptional individuals with a wish to change the world get help
            translating their wishes into action; TED<sup>x</sup>, which
            supports individuals or groups in hosting local, self- organized
            TED-style events around the world, and the TED Fellows program,
            helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to amplify
            the impact of their remarkable projects and activities.
