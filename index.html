          <p>
            In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED<sup>x</sup> is a program
            of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share
            a TED-like experience. At a TED<sup>x</sup> event, TED Talks video
            and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection.
            These local, self-organized events are branded TED<sup>x</sup>,
            where <sup>x</sup> = independently organized TED event. The TED
            Conference provides general guidance for the TED<sup>x</sup>
            program, but individual TED<sup>x</sup> events are self-organized.

            annual TED Conference takes place each spring in Vancouver, British
            Columbia. TED's media initiatives include&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ted.com">TED.com</a>, where new TED

            exceptional individuals with a wish to change the world get help
            translating their wishes into action; TED<sup>x</sup>, which
